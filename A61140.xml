            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58840:112"/>or diſtruſt, is little available; nor is Faith leſs the Parent of Charity, for it produces not only a ſtedfaſt Belief and Truſt in GOD, but a love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him and relyance on him, with a true acknowledgment of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both in Word, Deed, and Thought. To let the contemplation of his Excellencies imploy our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care, and poſſeſs the very center of our Souls, is a great Sign of true Faith, eſpecially if nothing of <hi>Vain-Glory</hi> be mixed therewith, but we are content to caſt our ſelves entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, eſtranging our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from Worldly things, and placing them upon thoſe that are laſting and Divine; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> This <hi>Faith comes by Hearing;</hi> and indeed it may well do ſo, for that the Ear conveys the Promiſes to the Soul, and there the <hi>Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> frames them in their divineſt ſhapes, whilſt <hi>Faith</hi> ſets its ſignet of true belief upon them, which muſt be likewiſe confirm'd by <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>Divine Love</hi> for although we had <hi>Faith</hi> even to remove Mountains, yet without <hi>Charity,</hi>

                           <hi>Hope</hi> in the Pallace of <hi>Vertue</hi> takes the next place, and is highly to be approved, becauſe it is the Mother of <hi>Patience,</hi> and the preventer of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,</hi> eacourages a Chriſtian in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and expectation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that is promiſed to thoſe that do well, and confirmed by <hi>Faith;</hi> for where as <hi>Faith,</hi> is a firm and ſteadfaſt belief in general, of all the revealed will of GOD, ſo is <hi>Hope</hi> of what more immediately concerns the party with whom it reſides, and is between the two Extremities of an infalible Aſſurance of Bleſſedneſs, and a Deſparation of it; and the more a man recovers from the laſt Extremity, the more perfect is his Hope: And in this caſe it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Believer, that he believes and loves GOD, that he hath a firm Affiance and Confidence that GOD of his good Grace will have Mercy and Compaſſion on him, and will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58840:113"/>give him whatſoever he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to his Elect, hoping that he is of their number And not only to hope, for that would be too ſupine &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, but to ſtrengthen that Hope with Prayer, Acts of Charity, and other Chriſtian Duties; ſo that in the end, <hi>Hope</hi> may not fail of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, but be ſatisfied with thoſe bleſſings it ſo earneſtly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Charity,</hi> the greateſt of theſe Three,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.8.</note> it is no doubt a garment of Righteouſneſs that covereth a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sins; and without this, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles accounted himſelf nothing. And to this I joyn <hi>Good Will,</hi> which is one and the ſame, for the truely Charitable Man willeth no Evil; and Love and Charity are inſeparable Companions, being linked together in a Chain of Cauſes, and conſiſt of Internal and External Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> Acts of Compaſſion, Love, Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Forbearance, Long Sufferance, Patience, and Brotherly kindneſs, as well as Liberality, relieving &amp; ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe that are in Diſtreſs or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, by Alms, good Counſel, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58840:113"/>whatever elſe is neceſſary or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, without any expectation of applauſe or retribution; for thoſe that give any thing upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, are like them that when they gave Alms, cauſed a Trumpet to be ſounded in the Market place, that they might have the praiſe of Men, ſo by that means it appears it was no true Charity, and conſequently not regiſter'd in Heaven; but on the contrary being attended with <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vain Glory,</hi> things moſt hateful to the Almighty, inſtead of laying up treaſure there, they treaſured up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath: Nay the proud Phariſee's meerly boaſting of what he had done in this kind, begat him rebuke and eternal infamy; for doubtleſs <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is a ſpark of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> which inflameth the heart and prepares it for the reception of ſaving Grace; and there is no thing more that our bleſſed Saviour takes notice of in his diſtinguiſhing the Righteous from the Wicked, at the laſt Day, then by the Charity of the one, and the Hard-Heartedneſs of the other; as you may find it at large in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25
